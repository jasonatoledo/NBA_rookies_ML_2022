instructions on how to run the code:

1) the 2 .csv files, "nba_players.csv" and "nba_rookies.csv" need to be in 
the same folder

2) the EDA file, zeta046_final_project_EDA.ipynb is a Jupyter Notebook file
that was used to create the models and can be run by clearing all code and
running the file from scratch

3) the executable .py file can be run in any IDE or Python window and will
return the file "nba_rookie_predictions.csv" as an output file
